# Memoize

### Abstract:

I built an app in React that enables the user to answer Git/ Github questions. I used an API to fetch the data.

### Installation Instructions:

Open Your Terminal

Copy and paste the following lines below into your terminal:


```git clone https://github.com/jamesb8891/memoize.git```

```cd memoize/```

```npm install```

```npm start```


### Project Background:

This project will help me learn how to build React apps and make an api call to obtain data and then utilize that data. This project is also an opportunity for me to build out a program based on user stories.

### Project Goals:

- Write a program from scratch
- Design and implement our app in React using states and props
- Implement ES6 classes
- Implement array iterator and mutator methods to work with Weather Underground data.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responibility Principle)

### Design and Layout
